<h1 id="btitle" style="font-size:5em;font-family:'Segoe UI Light','Segoe','Segoe UI','Helvetica Neue',sans-serif;">How a veteran entrepreneur is helping Microsoft double down on startups</h1><br>
<p id="fpara" style="padding-top:1%;">No one would have thought Jeff Ma would land where he did, least of all Ma himself.<br><br>
For decades, Ma has been known in Silicon Valley as an entrepreneur who launched and sold several successful and diverse companies. More famously, he was a member of the MIT blackjack team that won millions from Las Vegas casinos and the inspiration for the main character in the movie “21” and the book “Bringing Down the House.” Ma has been an options trader, was a water polo coach for years, is an author and professional speaker, and has been a writer and on-air personality for ESPN.
<br><br>
He is, in other words, someone who defies easy pigeonholing. And when Ma took on a new role in the spring, the move raised eyebrows across Silicon Valley’s startup community. The seasoned entrepreneur with the colorful and unpredictable career was going to … one of the world’s tech giants?
<br><br>
“The fact that he went to Microsoft is a big deal,” said Kevin Compton, former operating partner at Kleiner Perkins and now co-founder of Radar Partners, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto. “People were surprised. He could have gone anywhere, and he went there.”
